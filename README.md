# Speech-recognition-
This project makes use of speech recognition and Google Speech-to-Text to convert the text to speech and speech to text..

Speech recognition is complex and hard to understand for the beginner. However, there is a library for a beginner to use for translating audio to text, which is known as Google Text-to-Speech (gTTs).This library uses a hidden Markov model (HMM) to recognize spoken words. HMMs are a type of statistical model that is often used in speech recognition and other tasks involving sequential data. It is trained on a large corpus of spoken English, which means that it can recognize a wide variety of accents and dialects. In addition to recognition, the library can also be used to generate text-to-speech output. 

This project is practicing the use of algorithms, handling exceptions, natural language processing, and neural networks.
